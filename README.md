# Project 4

# Creating mock data to test the accuracy of our model:

# In order to complete this task, I had a tutor help me review and fix my code. 

# I imported the necessary libraries and set a random seed for reproducibility. I generated cardiovascular synthetic disease data focusing on age, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, BMI, and blood pressure category. I generated the age in years using the np.random function. I generated systolic blood pressure with realistic ranges, as well as diastolic blood pressure. Next, I calculated BMI with realistic ranges, calculated the height and weight.  Next, I determined the blood pressure categories based on both systolic and diastolic. Then, I calculated the cardiovascular disease risk using the previoursly stated predictive factors. Finally, I stored the information in a DataFrame.

# Visualizing cardio data: Next, I created visuals to show the blood pressure category distribution, BMI vs. Blood Pressure, and Age distribution by disease status.

# Saving the data: Finally, I saved the generated DataFrame into a csv file.
